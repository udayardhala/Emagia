We are using uptime robot for urls monitoring with free version.  
With free version we could receive notification to two contacts earlier but now it allows only one group mail or indvidual emailid only. 
But we want to add support@emagia.com also to sent uptime robot alerts, for this we need premium version.



put jde in db connectivity
put application names also at the urls
put as api at the lock symbol


During my call with Vinod, I have mentioned the applications as Emagia and GIA Docs along with the urls and also how they 
interact with each other. Also please indicate how the database is accessed by the application and how it is secured. 


Hi sunil

As we discussed i have modifed the Architecture diagram. Using JWT Authentication GiaDocs and Emagia Erms interact with each other. ERMS application 
is connected with database using JDBC drivers. Our entire production infra placed with in Private subnets.

IMDSv2 and SSH2 both same?

No, IMDSv2 (Instance Metadata Service Version 2) and SSH2 (Secure Shell version 2) are not the same. 
They are two distinct technologies used for different purposes in the context of computer systems and cloud services.

IMDSv2 (Instance Metadata Service Version 2):

IMDSv2 is a service provided by cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) for virtual instances, 
such as Amazon EC2 instances. It allows these instances to retrieve metadata about themselves, such as instance identity, 
network configuration, and other relevant information. 
IMDSv2 is designed to enhance security by providing improved protection against attacks like SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)
and unauthorized access to sensitive instance information.

SSH2 (Secure Shell version 2):

SSH2 is a cryptographic network protocol used for secure communication and remote access between two computers. It provides a secure channel over an unsecured network (such as the internet) for executing commands on a remote server, transferring files, and managing network devices. SSH2 offers strong encryption, authentication methods (including password and public key), and secure tunneling capabilities. It is widely used by system administrators, developers, and other users to access and manage remote systems securely.

In summary, IMDSv2 is a service that allows virtual instances to retrieve metadata about themselves securely,
while SSH2 is a protocol for secure remote access and communication between two computers. 
They serve different purposes in the realm of cloud computing and network security.
